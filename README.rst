**Talking Points**

Welcome and wait for everyone to settle.

*2 - A bit about me*

Discuss the bullet points.

Talk through the slides that Ben made.

*3 - Locality of behaviour*

Basically means that all of the code relating to the element that is displayed
in the webpage is right there. You don't need to refer to a bunch of other files
just to understand what is going on.

Tailwind also removes all of the default styling from the browser. This gives a clean
slate when starting a project and removes any potential conflicts with your classes.
